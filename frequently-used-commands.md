## vi
# Command Mode:
When vi starts up, it is in Command Mode. This mode is where vi interprets any characters we type as commands and thus does not display them in the window. This mode allows us to move through a file, and to delete, copy, or paste a piece of text.
To enter into Command Mode from any other mode, it requires pressing the [Esc] key. If we press [Esc] when we are already in Command Mode, then vi will beep or flash the screen.
# Insert mode:
This mode enables you to insert text into the file. Everything thatâ€™s typed in this mode is interpreted as input and finally, it is put in the file. The vi always starts in command mode. To enter text, you must be in insert mode. To come in insert mode you simply type i. To get out of insert mode, press the Esc key, which will put you back into command mode.
# Last Line Mode (Escape Mode):
Line Mode is invoked by typing a colon [:], while vi is in Command Mode. The cursor will jump to the last line of the screen and vi will wait for a command. This mode enables you to perform tasks such as saving files, executing commands.
